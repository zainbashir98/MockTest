            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions & Detailed User Guide</h1>
            <p>Welcome to our comprehensive FAQ section. Here, we cover everything you need to know about using our <strong>stylish font generator</strong> and <strong>profile picture maker</strong> effectively for your social media growth.</p>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is a Unicode Font Generator?</h3>
                <p>A Unicode font generator is a sophisticated tool that utilizes the international character encoding standard known as Unicode. When you enter standard text, our algorithm maps each letter to a mathematically styled symbol (MATHEMATICAL ALPHANUMERIC SYMBOLS) that resides in the higher planes of the Unicode map. This is why you can copy and paste these "fonts" into Instagram bios, TikTok captions, and WhatsApp messages—they aren't actually font files, but unique characters that almost every modern device can render perfectly.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is using stylish fonts safe for my social media account?</h3>
                <p>Yes, absolutely. Since we use standard Unicode characters, it is perfectly safe. Millions of users use these characters daily to make their bios more engaging. However, for maximum accessibility (for people using screen readers), we recommend using stylish fonts for decorative elements, names, or short call-to-actions, rather than your entire bio or long captions.</p>

                <h3>How do I use the Profile Picture Maker?</h3>
                <p>Our PFP Maker is designed for simplicity and professional results. Follow these steps:
                    <br>1. Scroll down to the <strong>Profile Picture Maker</strong> section on our homepage.
                    <br>2. Click 'Upload Photo' to select an image from your device.
                    <br>3. Use the color swatches to change the <strong>Background Color</strong> (perfect for removing distracting backgrounds).
                    <br>4. Adjust the <strong>Border Color</strong> and <strong>Border Width</strong> to create a striking "Instagram Story" ring effect.
                    <br>5. Click 'Download' to save your high-resolution round profile picture.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why does some text appear as squares (boxes)?</h3>
                <p>This phenomenon, often called "tofu," happens when the device you are using doesn't have the specific Unicode character set installed in its system font. This is mostly seen on very old Android versions (pre-Android 5.0) or outdated desktop browsers. Modern iPhones and latest Android devices have nearly 100% coverage for these symbols.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I use these for professional branding?</h3>
                <p>Creative typography is a powerful branding tool. By using consistent font styles across your TikTok captions and Instagram bio, you create a unique "visual voice." Many successful brands use our **Glitch Text** for tech-themed posts or **Cursive Scripts** for luxury and lifestyle branding.</p>
